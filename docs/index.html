        <h1>Whitehack Third Edition</h1>
        <h2>An unofficial FoundryVTT system</h2>

        <p>
          I've been rather taken with the Whitehack RPG from Christian Mehrstam, in particular the current third
          edition. You'll need to grab a copy of Whitehack Third Edition to get the best out of this FoundryVTT system,
          there's loads more information about it at the <a href="https://whitehackrpg.wordpress.com/">Whitehack
            website.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          While some systems try to mimic the layout of paper/pdf character sheets I realised early on that while this
          may be more aesthetically pleasing it would not present as usable a character sheet in a VTT, so I went for a
          design I have found useful in numerous apps - a top 'header' area with the main and most commonly referenced
          information on the character and a tabs section beneath it which can be used to drill into more detailed areas
          of the character. I hope you find this works well for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thanks to Christian Mehrstam for giving this FoundryVTT system his approval and of course for producing such
          a great game in the first place.
        </p>

        <h3>Characters, NPCs and Monsters</h3>

        <h4>Character Sheet</h4>

        <img src="images/character-attributes.png"
             alt="The FoundryVTT Whitehack 3e character sheet showing stats and tabs" />

        <p>
          Most of this will be self explanatory. Fields that have abbreviations or are a bit more complex will usually
          have a tooltip with more info if you mouse over them.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Class: select one of the five classes, this will change the available bonuses for attributes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vocation and Species: these fields are read only. They show the first active Vocation/Species added
            in the Abilities tab.
          </li>
          <li>
            Level, Slots, Groups, Attack Value (AV), Movement (MV): standard inputs, enter the
            relevant value for the chosen class.
          </li>
          <li>
            Corruption Level (CL): starts at 0, update manually as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Saving Throw (ST): enter manually for class. Click on the label (with dice) to make a save (the Saving Throw
            dialog will pop up).
          </li>
          <li>
            Armour Class (AC): read only, calculated from armour equipped in the Armour tab. Only the highest piece of
            equipped armour will contribute towards AC.
          </li>
          <li>
            Encumbrance (ENC): read only, calculated from equipped and stored armour, gear and weapons. Show in red
            when values are above the 10 equipped and 5 stored levels.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Tabs</h4>

        <p>
          The labels across the middle of the sheet give access to tabs. Most of these tabs present lists of items in
          tables which all have in common edit and delete icons, so individual items can be updated for the character or
          removed from the character sheet.
        </p>

        <h5>Attributes Tab</h5>

        <p>
          Shown above, this should be familiar to most gamers with the standard D&amp;D style attributes. The label
          (with dice) for each attribute can be clicked to perform an attribute task check.
        </p>
        <p>
          The score is entered manually, but the modifier boxes are read only and updated based on the scores entered.
          A tooltip identifies what each is used for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final section for each attribute is groups. The text field is read only and is populated from the Select
          Groups Dialog (accessed by clicking on the three horizontal bars) and cleared with the rubbish bin icon.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="four columns">
            <img src="images/select-groups-dialog.png" alt="The select groups dialog showing active groups" />
          </div>
          <div class="eight columns">
            <p>
              The Select Groups dialog allows the player to choose which group or groups to apply to an attribute. It
              only shows groups which are marked as active.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>Abilities Tab</h5>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="six columns">
            <img src="images/character-abilities.png" alt="Tab showing abilities added to character sheet" />
          </div>
          <div class="six columns">
            <p>
              Attunements, Combat Options, Miracles and Groups all go in here. Along with the type of ability, the
              active column gives an indicator to which is currently active and affects which groups can be assigned to
              attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clicking on the icon for the ability will show the ability name and description (if any) in the chat.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>Weapons Tab</h5>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="six columns">
            <img src="images/character-weapons.png" alt="Tab showing weapons added to character sheet" />
          </div>
          <div class="six columns">
            <p>
              Stats are shown for each weapon along with whether it is equipped or stored which updates the encumbrance
              totals appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clicking on the icon for the weapon shows the weapon attack dialog which can be used to make a weapon
              attack. The results of the weapon attack are shown in chat.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>Armour Tab</h5>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="six columns">
            <img src="images/character-armour.png" alt="Tab showing armour added to character sheet" />
          </div>
          <div class="six columns">
            <p>
              Stats are shown for each piece of armour along with whether it is equipped or stored which updates
              encumbrance totals and armour class appropriately. While each piece of armour will add to one of the
              encumbrance totals, only the heaviest piece of armour (the one with the highest AC) will be taken into
              account in the final AC.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shields add +1 to AC when equipped. Helmets do not affect the final AC, but have a special affect as
              described in the Whitehack rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clicking on the icon for armour will show the armour name, AC and description (if any) in the chat.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>Gear Tab</h5>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="six columns">
            <img src="images/character-gear.png" alt="Tab showing gear added to character sheet" />
          </div>
          <div class="six columns">
            <p>
              Stats are shown for each item of gear along with whether it is equipped or stored which updates
              encumbrance totals appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
              GP, SP and CP can be added to the gear tab from the compendium, with the amount updated appropriately.
              Treasure can be added as and when acquired.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clicking on the icon for gear will show the gear name and description (if any) in the chat.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>Notes Tab</h5>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="six columns">
            <img src="images/character-notes.png" alt="Tab showing gear added to character sheet" />
          </div>
          <div class="six columns">
            <p>
              This is a catch all section for languages and whatever notes a player wishes to record about their
              character.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h4>Dialogs</h4>

        <img src="images/roll-dialogs.png" alt="Saving Throw, Attribute Task Check and Attack dialogs" />

        <p>
          Besides the Select Groups dialog shown above there are three other dialogs that appear for Saving Throws,
          Attribute Task Checks and Attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each accepts a modifier (or To Hit and Damage modifiers for attacks) and the player can click the button for
          whichever die roll is required:
        <ul>
          <li>
            D20: standard single D20 roll
          </li>
          <li>
            D20 with plus sign: a double positive roll
          </li>
          <li>
            D20 with minus sign: a double negative roll
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Monster Sheet</h4>

        <img src="images/monster.png" alt="Monster stats and info" />
        <p>
          Again pretty much self explanatory. Saving Throw (ST) and Attack Value (AV) are read only and generated from
          the first Hit Dice input, and both can be rolled by clicking on the label (with dice). As with characters, the
          appropriate dialog will be shown to modify the roll or make a double positive or double negative roll.
          Initiative can also be rolled if the Monster Sheet is opened from a token.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of the fields can be manually updated.
        </p>

        <h3>Items</h3>
        <p>As well as a compendium of items (see below), game masters can add items to the item panel and players can
          add items directly to their character sheet by clicking the plus icon in the header of the right hand column
          of tabs.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="six columns">
            <img src="images/ability.png" alt="Add or edit ability" />
          </div>
          <div class="six columns">
            <img src="images/armour.png" alt="Add or edit armour" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="six columns">
            <img src="images/gear.png" alt="Add or edit gear" />
          </div>
          <div class="six columns">
            <img src="images/weapon.png" alt="Add or edit weapons" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <h4>Compendiums</h4>

        <p>There are compendiums for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Armour</li>
          <li>Gear</li>
          <li>Weapons</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Items from these compendiums can be dragged directly onto a character or for later use in the items panel.
        </p>

        <h4>Encumbrance</h4>

        <p>I have slightly modified the encumbrance system, based on a regular item taking one slot:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Heavy (2 slots)</li>
          <li>Regular (1 slot)</li>
          <li>Minor (2 per slot)</li>
          <li>Small (5 per slot)</li>
          <li>Negligible (100 per slot)</li>
          <li>No Encumbrance (appears as &quot;&dash;&dash;&dash;&quot;, doesn't use character encumbrance slots)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rolls</h3>

        <h4>Saving Throws and Task Checks</h4>
        <p>
          Dice rolls are compatible with the Dice So Nice module. Dice results show successful positive pair, crit,
          success, failure, fumble, unsuccessful negative pair along with the dice rolled. As with standard FoundryVTT
          dice rolls you can click on the result to see the actual dice rolled.
        </p>

        <h3>Combat</h3>

        <h4>Initiative</h4>

        <p>The system supports the FoundryVTT initiative system. After actors have been added to the combat tracker
          you can roll initiative from there or from the relevant token on a battle map.</p>

        <h4>Attack Rolls</h4>

        <p>
          Attack rolls show the AC hit (I may add in targetting to pick up AC from tokens) and if the attack is
          successful (in that the to hit roll is less than or equal to attack value) damage will also be rolled. It is
          then down to the GM to determine if the to hit roll exceeded the targets AC and to manually deduct hit points
          from tokens.
        </p>

        <h3>Compatibility with modules</h3>

        <p>
          Most FoundryVTT modules will work fine with this system, but there are some that need some specific handling.
          There may be some unforeseen conflicts around similarly named classes or handling of events. So far I've
          tweaked the sheet to ensure this system works with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dice So Nice</li>
          <li>Pop-out</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Should you find problems with other modules (checking by disabling and enabling the module first) <a
             href="https://github.com/neilbenson/foundryvtt-whitehack-3e/issues">raise an issue</a> and if I am able to
          I'll do my best to resolve them.
        </p>

        <h3>Work in Progress</h3>

        <p>
          All feedback is welcome (although if it is negative please be polite) as I expect to make enhancements to this
          system as time permits. Bug fixes will always take priority over new features. Issues can be reported at the
          github project for this system <a href="https://github.com/hellbrandt/foundryvtt-whitehack-3e">here</a>.
